- Each coordinator call related viewModel and view
- ViewModel make network call and interact with service
- Api detail are in ViewModel
- Network service are there
- Model are codable object with no logic
- View are swiftUI view
- Binding is via observable

## Perfomance
- Image Cached via CachedAsyncImage 
- Video perfomance via - Showing image thumb while video is loading to improve feel
- Video not cahced but only image. 
- Network response not cached as they change.

## Error Case handling
- Error in network call and retry are handled via FirstApiView and ApiCallLodable protocol and APIResultViewModel
- FirstApiView manages state like loading, error and retry and view for same
- APIResultViewModel maintian error, state of network call etc
- ApiCallLodable protocol declares that api call will be made.

## Themes
